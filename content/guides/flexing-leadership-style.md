> One of the most powerful traits in effective leaders isnâ€™t just decisiveness or visionâ€”itâ€™s the ability to adapt. In my own leadership journey, Iâ€™ve realized that different situations, teams, and even individuals need different things from a leader. You donâ€™t become a better leader by always taking charge. Sometimes, you do it by stepping back.

The [Tannenbaum and Schmidt Leadership Continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannenbaum_and_Schmidt_Continuum) models leadership not as a fixed trait, but as a *sliding scale of authority and freedom*. It illustrates seven leadership styles ranging from *manager-centered* to *team-centered*.

This model is especially helpful for engineers and tech leads transitioning into *Staff-plus roles*, where leadership is increasingly about *influence* and *adaptability*, not command-and-control.

## The full continuum

Below is a breakdown of the seven styles from the Tannenbaum-Schmidt model:

| *Style*      | *Description* |
|------------|-------------|
| *Tells*      | Manager makes the decision and announces it. No team input. |
| *Sells*      | Manager makes the decision and explains reasoning to gain team buy-in. |
| *Suggests*   | Manager presents decision and welcomes questions or feedback. |
| *Consults*   | Manager outlines the problem, invites team input, then makes the decision. |
| *Joins*      | Manager and team brainstorm options together; manager makes final call. |
| *Delegates*  | Manager defines boundaries and lets the team decide within those constraints. |
| *Abdicates*  | Team has full autonomy to explore, decide, and act. Manager provides minimal guidance. |

This continuum shows that leadership is *not binary* instead, it's a matter of *how much control you retain versus how much freedom you grant*.

## Why leadership flexibility matters

Rigid leadership (always using one style) can stifle innovation or create friction. Conversely, flexing your approach based on *urgency, team experience, and risk level* leads to better outcomes and healthier team dynamics.

For example:

- Use *Tells* during incidents or high-risk decisions.
- Use *Joins* or *Delegates* during long-term planning or innovation projects.
- Use *Consults* or *Suggests* when trust is being built or expertise is uneven.

In Staff-plus roles, your ability to pick the *right style at the right time* is as critical as technical execution.

## Internal leadership visibility

Being a flexible leader only matters if people can see and understand it. To create internal visibility:

*   Explain your decision-making style choices in project kickoffs or retros.
*   Share leadership shifts in internal documentation or postmortems.
*   Use team rituals (like demos or syncs) to showcase inclusive decision-making.
*   Show how youâ€™ve helped team members grow into decision-makers by gradually shifting toward *Delegates* or *Abdicates*.

Documenting how and when you apply the continuum demonstrates self-awareness and emotional intelligence key traits for Staff-plus leaders.

## Executive visibility

Executives value scalable leadership. That means:

- Empowering others to make good decisions.
- Creating clarity without micromanaging.
- Knowing when *not* to lead directly.

Use your [promotion packet](/guides/promo-packets) to showcase times you've moved along the continuumâ€”especially toward *Joins*, *Delegates*, and *Abdicates* to develop leadership in others.

You can also:

*   Include reasoning behind your style in planning docs.
*   Share how shifting leadership led to improved outcomes.
*   Reflect on leadership balance during strategy reviews with your manager's manager.

## External visibility

You can strengthen your external credibility by teaching this framework through:

*   Blog posts analyzing how you led differently across projects.
*   Conference talks about leading distributed or high-autonomy teams.
*   Podcasts on decision-making and psychological safety.
*   Case studies or internal playbooks demonstrating leadership transitions.

Sharing how you've moved across the continuum not only elevates your voice it helps others grow into thoughtful leaders.

## Should _you_ focus on leadership style flexibility?

If you're always leading from the same position on the continuum, you're missing opportunities to empower your team and grow yourself.

Ask yourself:

- Have I ever fully delegated or abdicated a decision?
- Do I involve the team more now than I did a year ago?
- Am I stuck in "Tells" mode because it feels safer?

Flexing along the continuum builds trust, resilience, and scale exactly what organizations look for in Staff-plus engineers.
