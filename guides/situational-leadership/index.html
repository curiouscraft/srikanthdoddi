Core Concept of Situational Leadership
Situational Leadership rests on the idea that leaders must adjust their style based on the readiness (ability and willingness) of their followers. The model identifies four leadership styles and matches them to the four development levels of employees."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.148.1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta name=author content="map[name:Srikanth Doddi]"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.8d048772ae72ab11245a0e296d1f2a36d3e3dd376c6c867394d6cc659c68fc37.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/static/pygments.css><link rel=canonical href=https://techleadmanager.com/guides/situational-leadership/><meta property="og:url" content="https://techleadmanager.com/guides/situational-leadership/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="From Code to Influence: A Software Engineer‚Äôs Journey"><meta property="og:title" content="Understanding Situational Leadership - A Practical Guide with Engineer-Manager Scenarios"><meta property="og:description" content="Situational Leadership is a flexible and adaptive leadership model developed by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard.
